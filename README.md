# Watermark Tool

This is a Python tool used to add watermarks to an image.

## Usage

To use this tool, download the main.py file and run with a Python IDE or Command Line.

Once it has run, a GUI will load. Click the Select Image button and choose a PNG or JPEG file. The textbox will show the name of the file for confirmation

Next, type the string that you would like to appear as the watermark and change the opacity and shade options as needed.

Click the Run button and a popup will confirm if the watermark was successfully added. Now you can click the Show Image to open the image or Save Image to save the image to the original location with a name of your choosing.

The tool can then be used again by uploading a new image or changing the settings.
